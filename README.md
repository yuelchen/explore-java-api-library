### Scanner
A java utility for obtaining input for primitive types and Strings; see below two projects for source examples:
- [GuessingGames](https://github.com/yuelchen/explore-java-api-library/tree/master/GuessingGames/src/com/yuelchen): a simple (number) guessing game where the user provides the system a range from which it can pick a random number. The user is then allowed to guess the random number the system generated and once correctly guessed, the system will return with the count of guesses made. 
- [IntroScanner](https://github.com/yuelchen/explore-java-api-library/tree/master/IntroScanner/src/com/yuelchen/main): a list of input prompts for retrieving String and primitive types (i.e. boolean, int, long and double) from within main method in the form of a survey and then returns summary at the end.
